## About Me 👨‍💻
<p>
I am a Junior Frontend Developer with over 2 years of experience in creating web applications and designing intuitive, attractive interfaces. I have worked on both national (Bolivia) and international projects (Chile), as well as a project in the United States. My experience includes development with Drupal (versions 8, 9, and 10) and React.js with Next.js, in addition to participating in a mobile application project using React Native.

I was also part of the web design team, using tools like Figma, where my designs have been deployed in production.

Furthermore, I have experience in server administration with Linux Ubuntu, which has allowed me to deploy in various environments such as Development, Testing, and Production. Currently, I use Linux Ubuntu as my primary operating system, and I have gained most of my work experience in this environment, which I greatly enjoy.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and finding ways to optimize what I have learned, which has allowed me to take on new challenges and grow as a professional.
